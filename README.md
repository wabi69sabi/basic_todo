# Basic To Do list app in RoR

This small TODO app is just an example of a quick scaffolded rails application that took about 30 minutes to build.

Requirements:

- The Ruby version used in this project is ruby-2.4.1.

- Ruby bundler 1.16.1 or higher

Most of the other requirements should install automatically with the following commands:

#### Setting up the application:

To get started open a terminal and type:

```
bundle install
```

Set up your database:

```
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
````

To run tests just type:

```
rake test
```

To start the app:

```
rails s
```

Now just browse to ``` localhost:3000 ``` to check out the application.

### To Do list:

- A good front end would be nice, possibly with cards and small check boxes.
- curl requests with JSON bodies can be send like this for example:
  - ``` curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST --data '{ "task" : { "name" : "JSON send with CURL", "status" : "false"} }' 127.0.0.1:3000/tasks.json ```

Ideas:

Create a full React frontend.
